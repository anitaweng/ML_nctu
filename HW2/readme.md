1. For problem 1, implementing sequential bayesian learning.
   The demonstrated result is shown as:

2. For problem 2, implementing a multiclass logistic regression model with PCA.
   The demonstrated results are shown as:

3. 
   

The files needs to be in the same directory as dataset.
One should create a 'result_1' folder with subfolder 1,2,3, for example:
result_1/1
result_1/2
result_1/3

Q1_2 should be in the same folder as fill_between.m and sigmoid.m.
